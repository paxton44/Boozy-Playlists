//Pseudo Code 

//make function that grabs the API 
//Var=APIGrabber = function (){}

//API pseudo code rough: Spotify uses genres to access all media inside its database. 
//get a list of all genres 
//get the playlists
//get the playlist items 
//get the songs from the playlist individually 

//Pseudo code code structure 
//make a var that grabs from spotify 
//it uses a token parameter from spotify 
//it then fetches the spotify api
//then grabs what you want based on how far into the database you went(genre, playlist, album, song)
//then it returns the selected music in JSON for your app
//then it returns to the app how the user expects to see the playlist or song
